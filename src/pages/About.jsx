                    <h1>About Imagine Tai Tokerau</h1>
                    <p>
                        Imagine Tai Tokerau will be a weekend of coming together, sharing ideas, networking and
                        developing meaningful, tangible solutions to local problems. Everybody who is passionate
                        about change is welcome. On Friday we will pitch ideas, vote on the best ones and then form
                        project teams. The teams will be led by experienced mentors of our community, who will make
                        sure that the idea will be condensed into a workable solution. Saturday and Sunday will be
                        dedicated to designing the projects, testing out the prototypes and finalising them. On
                        Sunday they will then be pitched to the judges, who will pick the most promising ones and
                        give out the prizes.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The goal of Imagine Tai Tokerau is to create lasting change, so we want to make sure that
                        the prized projects will then be given the long-term support they need to be implemented in
                        our community.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We want to make the event as inclusive as possible, to accurately reflect the diverse
                        population of Tai Tokerau. We actively encourage and welcome participants of all age groups,
                        genders, social backgrounds and cultures.
